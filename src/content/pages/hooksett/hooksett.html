                <p>Make your small business website work for you. We hand-code all our client sites to ensure they perform quickly, engage customers, and drive more sales.

                <h2>Custom Web Development That Outperforms WordPress</h2>
                <h3>Hooksett, NH</h3>
                <p>
                    Here's the difference between a good website and a great one - how it's built. Our custom coded websites eliminate the bloated code, slow databases, and security vulnerabilities that plague WordPress, Squarespace and Wix sites. Let's create your New Hampshire small business something unique and eye-catching - not another business template website that 30% of your competitors are also using.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Why Does Speed Even Matter</h3>
                <p>All our website starts as a blank canvas. No templates, no plugins, no compromises. This approach offers a few important advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our websites load instantly to keep visitors engaged because lets be honest - most people won't even wait 3 seconds for a site to load</li>
                    <li>We consistently achieve +95/100 Google Page Speed scores for better rankings</li>
                    <li>Bulletproof security without the constant updates like WordPress</li>
                    <li>Complete design freedom. No limits. No constraints. We love a challenge.</li>
                    <li>Zero maintenance headaches - we fully manage your website so you can focus on your Hooksett, NH small business</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why Custom Coded Websites Over WordPress Themes or DIY Page Builders?</h2>
                <p>Using website builders is extremely convenient, so we don't fault folks for using them, but there are some serious considerations to consider when deciding how to handle the development of your website. While most businesses default to pre-made templates and drag-and-drop builders, we take a different approach. Every website we make is crafted one line at a time, which delivers a level of performance that mass-produced solutions simply can't match:</p>
    
                <h3>Google Loves Clean Code</h3>
                <p>Having a website that search engines can quickly and simply make sense of should not be underestimated. WordPress code is chaotic and confusing to search engines like Google - full of unnecessary bloat, outdated plugins, and slow loading third-party code. Our code on the other hand is like a perfectly organized manuscript, bespoke for your Hooksett, NH small business, making it effortless for Google to understand and rank your content effectively.</p>
    
                <h3>True Mobile-First Development</h3>
                <p>Page Builder's advertise 'mobile first design', but they don't fully execute on this promise. It's just like forcing a square peg into a round hole - it might eventually fit, but it's not pretty. Our approach? We build your website for smartphones from day one, then scale up to larger screens. This natural progression aligns perfectly with Google's evaluation methods since they use what's called "Mobile First Indexing" to rank your website, enhancing your visibility in mobile searches. We have professional web designers create your website layout for all screen sizes, and lets be honest, while anyone could build a website using a page builder, sometimes its best to leave this type of work for a professional.</p>
    
                <h3>Get A Website Designed for You</h3>
                <p>Many people rely on paid WordPress themes and page builders because it's cheaper and easier. Create an account, start building, and you'll have a site in a matter of hours. The trade-off here is that it won't be SEO researched, have the proper structure to convert customers, or the page speed and performance for customers to even FIND your website. You'll be buried by your competitors who have budgets for PPC advertising, SEO teams, and longer tenure in the Hooksett, NH business community. It also comes with drawback of not being able to truly customize the design to your liking. No matter how many times you ask, they won't be able to make what you want exactly and will have to settle for the limitations of the platform they are using. Same with drag and drop page builders. There's only so much they can do and you quickly reach their limits.</p>
                <p>With our custom coded approach, we aren't limited by anything. Our designers can create any design you want. You dream it, and we'll continue to tweak it to perfectly match your vision. We make sure it's responsive for all screen sizes, have more control over our work than most other agencies, which is why business owners from Hooksett and the surrounding Southern New Hampshire region come to us to build their websites. We give you what the other agencies can't - and cheaper too.</p>

                <h2>Benefits of Custom Coded Websites</h2>
                <h3>No Plugin Dependencies</h3>
                <p>WordPress sites are like a series of cogs in a complicated machine - if one breaks, the whole thing stops working. To avoid this, our websites come fully equipped with everything you need, built right into the foundation. No extra monthly fees from plugins, no compatibility headaches, just reliable performance without all the baggage and headache.</p>
    
                <h3>Complete Creative Freedom</h3>
                <p>Template websites or page builders are essentially a fancy painting by numbers - it's true that you'll end up with a pretty picture, but it's the same one everyone else has in the area. With Esker Designs, we give you a blank canvas and ask you, "Ok - so what do you want to build?". And then we build it - no compromises, nothing off limits. Want something innovative? Something unique to your brand? We can build it without hitting the same limitations they have limitations.</p>
    
                <h3>Built for Long-Term Performance</h3>
                <p>Wordpress plugins age  out, break, and aren't perpetually support by developers. Our hand-coded sites? They're built and maintained by us. No third parties, which allows them to maintain peak performance year after year, with no tune-ups required. Your site stays fast, secure, and effective without the constant need for updates and fixes, although we do offer unlimited edits to adapt with your business as it changes.</p>

            <section class="performance">
                <h2>Faster Loading Websites Convert More Visitors Into Customers</h2>
                <p>Website speed isn't just a technical benchmark - it has a major impact on results. By having a site that loads instantly, you retain customers that websites with 3-5 second load time miss out on. If your website takes 3 seconds to load you are losing up to 50% of your traffic because they leave the site before it can load. This is how slow websites hold you back. We fix that from day 1.</p>
    
                <h3>Converting Visitors into Customers</h3>
                <p>Our hand-coded websites consistently outperform template-based and DIY page builder websites sites in all key metrics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher conversion rates from faster loading</li>
                    <li>Longer visit duration from better performance</li>
                    <li>More pages viewed per session</li>
                    <li>Lower bounce rates from instant loading</li>
                    <li>Better user engagement across all devices</li>
                    <li>Better security, our websites are unhackable</li>
                    <li>Smarter content structure and website layout that is proven to convert more traffic</li>
                </ul>
