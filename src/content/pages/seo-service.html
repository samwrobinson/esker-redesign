            <p>Esker Designs is a small business SEO agency serving Vermont and nationwide. We provide local SEO services for small business owners who want to attract more customers from Google searches. Our approach combines technical SEO expertise with hand-coded website development, giving your business a foundation that search engines love.</p>

            <h2>Our Small Business SEO Approach</h2>
            <p>As a local SEO agency, we focus on what actually moves the needle for small businesses—not bloated strategies designed for enterprise companies. Our SEO services for small business are built around three principles: technical excellence, local visibility, and measurable results.</p>

            <p>Our hand-coded websites already include the technical SEO foundation that most businesses pay extra for. When you work with us, you're not starting from scratch—you're building on a website that search engines already trust. This means faster results and better long-term performance.</p>

            <p>Our <a href="/web-design-service/">web design process</a> ensures every website we build scores 95-100 on Google PageSpeed and loads in under one second—both confirmed ranking factors. Our clean, semantic HTML structure helps search engines understand your content, while our mobile-first approach aligns perfectly with Google's mobile-first indexing. Unlike WordPress or page builders that load dozens of unnecessary scripts, our hand-coded sites deliver only what's needed. The result: faster load times, lower bounce rates, and a technical foundation that gives your SEO a head start from day one.</p>

            <h2>Local SEO Services for Small Business</h2>
            <p>For businesses that serve local customers, local SEO is essential. Our local SEO marketing services help you appear in Google's local pack and map results when nearby customers search for your services.</p>

            <h2>Content & On-Page SEO Services</h2>

            </ul>

            <h2>Technical SEO Services</h2>
            <p>Many SEO companies for small business overlook technical fundamentals. We don't. Our technical SEO services ensure search engines can easily crawl, index, and understand your website.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Site speed optimization</strong> - our hand-coded sites score 95-100 on PageSpeed</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile SEO optimization</strong> for Google's mobile-first indexing</li>
                <li><strong>Schema markup implementation</strong> for rich search results</li>
                <li><strong>XML sitemap creation</strong> and submission</li>
                <li><strong>Core Web Vitals optimization</strong> and monitoring</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Why Choose Esker Designs as Your Small Business SEO Agency</h2>
            <p>Not all SEO agencies for small business are created equal. Here's what makes us different:</p>

            <h3>Built-In Technical Excellence</h3>
            <p>Unlike other SEO companies for small business that have to fix slow, bloated websites before optimization can begin, our hand-coded sites are already built for speed and search performance. You're not paying to fix problems—you're investing in growth.</p>

            <h3>Local SEO Specialist Focus</h3>
            <p>As a Vermont-based local SEO specialist, we understand the unique challenges of marketing a small business in our state. Whether you're in Burlington, Montpelier, or a rural community, we know how to connect you with local customers searching for your services.</p>

            <h3>Affordable SEO Services for Small Business</h3>
            <p>Many SEO companies hide their pricing behind "custom quotes." We believe in straightforward, affordable SEO services for small business owners with real budgets. You'll know exactly what you're paying for and what results to expect.</p>

            <h3>No Link Building Upsells</h3>
            <p>Quality link building costs $5,000-$25,000+ per month—far outside most small business budgets. We focus on what actually works for local businesses: technical excellence, great content, and local SEO. No expensive link building campaigns required.</p>

            <h2>Results from Our SEO Services</h2>
            <p>When you work with our small business SEO agency, you can expect:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Improved visibility in Google's local pack and map results</li>
                <li>Higher rankings for keywords your customers actually search</li>
                <li>Increased organic traffic from qualified local customers</li>
                <li>Better conversion rates from faster site performance</li>
                <li>Monthly reporting so you always know where you stand</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SEO Help for Small Business: Our Process</h2>
            <p>Getting SEO help for small business shouldn't be complicated. We've streamlined our process to minimize your time investment while maximizing results.</p>

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        SEO is a long-term strategy. Most small businesses start seeing meaningful improvements in 3-6 months, with results compounding over time. Unlike paid advertising, the traffic you build through SEO continues working for you without ongoing ad spend.

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        Not necessarily. We can optimize existing websites. However, if your current site is slow, outdated, or built on a bloated platform, our hand-coded websites provide a much stronger foundation for SEO success.

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        Local SEO focuses on helping you appear in searches with local intent—like "plumber near me" or "best restaurant in Burlington." It emphasizes <a href="/google-business-profile-management/">Google Business Profile optimization</a>, local citations, and location-based keywords. Regular SEO targets broader search visibility regardless of location.

                        We focus on local SEO, technical SEO, and content optimization rather than link building. Quality link building typically costs $5,000-$25,000+ per month—far outside most small business budgets. The good news is that for local businesses, strong technical SEO, great content, and local citations often deliver excellent results without expensive link building campaigns.
