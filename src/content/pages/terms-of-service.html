You can cancel the SMS service at any time. Simply text "STOP" to the same number that sent you messages. Upon sending "STOP," we will confirm your unsubscribe status via SMS. Following this confirmation, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. To rejoin, sign up as you did initially, and we will resume sending SMS messages to you.</p>
