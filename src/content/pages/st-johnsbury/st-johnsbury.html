            <h1 class="cs-title">St. Johnsbury Vermont Web Designer | Custom Website Development</h1>
            <p>Transform your online presence with a website that's engineered for performance. While other developers push WordPress templates and page builders, we create hand-coded websites that load instantly, rank higher in search results, and consistently outperform the competition in the Northeast Kingdom.</p>

            <h2>Why Custom Code Beats WordPress for St. Johnsbury Businesses</h2>
            <p>Think of your website like the historic St. Johnsbury Athenaeum - you wouldn't replace its hand-crafted architecture with prefab construction. The same principle applies to your website. WordPress and page builders are like using mass-produced materials when you need custom craftsmanship. Our development approach delivers the difference between basic functionality and engineered excellence.</p>

            <h3>The Problem with Generic WordPress Sites in St. Johnsbury</h3>
            <p>In a region where standing out matters, using the same platform as 43% of the internet puts you at a disadvantage. When every business on Railroad Street uses similar themes and plugins, how can you possibly differentiate yourself? Our hand-coded approach eliminates everything that holds sites back:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>No bloated themes loading unnecessary features</li>
                <li>Zero plugin-related performance issues</li>
                <li>No database queries slowing down every page</li>
                <li>No excess code dragging down speed</li>
                <li>No security vulnerabilities putting your business at risk</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Dominate Local Search Results in the Northeast Kingdom</h2>
            <p>Every second your site takes to load costs you customers. In St. Johnsbury's competitive market, from Main Street to Eastern Avenue, you can't afford to lose visitors to slow loading times. Our sites load in under one second, creating an advantage that template-based competitors can't match.</p>

            <h3>Performance That Sets You Apart</h3>
            <p>Our approach consistently delivers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sub-second load times even on mobile networks</li>
                <li>Perfect 100/100 Google Core Web Vitals scores</li>
                <li>Zero database latency</li>
                <li>Instant page transitions</li>
                <li>Superior user experience metrics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Strategic Digital Marketing for St. Johnsbury</h2>
            <h3>Advanced SEO Engineering</h3>
            <p>In the Northeast Kingdom, where local reputation matters, SEO isn't just about keywords anymore. We build ranking power into every aspect of your site, from technical architecture that Google loves to content strategies that connect with your local audience. Whether you're near the Academy or downtown, we help you get found.</p>

            <p>Competition in St. Johnsbury might not be as fierce as major cities, but that doesn't mean SEO is any less crucial. We understand the unique dynamics of ranking in smaller markets, where local authority and community connection can make a significant difference in search visibility.</p>

            <h3>Local Business Focus</h3>
            <p>Just because you're a small business in St. Johnsbury doesn't mean your website should look small. We specialize in creating professional, unique designs that maintain the charm of a local business while projecting the professionalism that builds trust with customers throughout Caledonia County.</p>
