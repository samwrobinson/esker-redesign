                Web development can be a real mysterious craft for most people, so I went ahead and compiled some of my most frequently asked questions below. As always, feel free to send me an email or give me a call if the question you have is not addressed here; or even if it is addressed here but you still want to chat!

                                Is there a minimum subscription length for the monthly package?
                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            The subscription plan requires a minimum of 12 months. After that, it goes month to month.You are free to cancel any time after the initial 12 months for no charge. The main thing to consider is that if you cancel your subscription after a year, you don't keep the site (otherwise everyone would just do that and we'd be out of business!).

                        </button>

                            You just have to sign a new 12 month contract.

                                What happens if I cancel before the initial 12 months has ended?
                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            If you cancel your subscription early, you owe the full cost of what the site would normally cost ($3000) minus whatever you already paid. We really prioritize long term relationships with our clients and we want to work with clients to share the same philosophy.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                                How do you handle late payments?
                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            If an invoice is not paid within 7 days, there will be a $25 late fee applied. If you're on a subscription, and there are multiple monthly invoices that are overdue for months and late for months, we can cancel the contract and the client will be responsible for paying the full price of the site. We are generally very flexible and understanding of certain situations and often times offer assistance and help. But if there is no communication or replies to our messages, we have to take certain precautions to make sure we are paid for our time and effort in making the site and not being taken advantage of.

                                What do you use to take payment and what payment methods do you accept?

                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            We send email invoices using Square which provides a link to a secure page for adding payment details. Subscriptions are paid with a credit card or debt card and we accept all major credit cards. Lump sum projects are paid with ACH bank transfer to minimize processing fees. Important to note, we <strong>do not accept money orders or checks</strong>.

                                $100 per additional page; is that one-time or monthly?

                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            The $100 per additional page fee is a <strong>one time fee</strong>, not recurring. So if you need 2 extra pages, that's $200 and you're done. Not $200 a month.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                                Are there refunds?
                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            Refunds are only available during the design phase of the contract. When you sign a contract, either lump sum or subscription, if we cannot design something you are 100% happy with and no longer want to move forward, then we will refund whatever you paid to get started. If we do end up moving forward with building the site, there are no refunds after that point. From then on, refunds are at our discretion.

                        <button class="cs-button">
                            <span class="cs-button-text">
                                On subscriptions, once I'm done with the 12 month minimum, do I continue paying after that?
                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            Our subscriptions are indefinite, which means you continue paying every month after the 12 month minimum. We structure our pricing this way because it typically takes us at least 3 years to earn the equivalent of what we'd receive from a lump-sum website project. Ideally, we aim for partnerships lasting 5+ years to make this payment schedule financially sustainable for our business.
                            By that point, your website will be generating significantly more value than the $175 monthly feeâ€”effectively paying for itself. We hope you'll continue recognizing the value of our ongoing services and maintain your subscription, allowing us to keep supporting your digital presence.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="cs-faq-item">

                            <span class="cs-button-text">
                                Can I buy out of my subscription after the subscription minimum has passed?
                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            No, we do not offer a buyout option for our monthly subscription. Our business model depends on long-term client relationships, as it takes 2-3 years just to earn what we would have made from a one-time payment. Subscriptions only become financially viable when clients stay for 5+ years.
                            This recurring revenue provides us with stable income, allowing us to focus on service rather than constant sales. Without the pressure to constantly replace lost clients, we can dedicate more time to supporting existing clients through responsive communication and site improvements. This creates the hands-on, attentive service that sets us apart from other agencies.

                            <span class="cs-button-text">
                                Can I add unlimited edits and support to the lump sum package?
                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            Most definitely! We offer $50 a month subscription add on for unlimited edits and support. These are done with a 12 month minimum commitment as well. There's no turning it on and off every other month. Once you end it, if you want to reinstate, it you'll need to sign another 12 month commitment.
                        </p>

                    <li class="cs-faq-item">

                            <span class="cs-button-text">
                                So what's the difference between lump sum and subscription?
                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            The main difference is long-term versus short-term costs. With a subscription, you'll pay more over time, but in small, manageable monthly installments. The lump sum option requires more upfront payment but saves money in the long run because you're paying for design and development all at once.
                            Your choice depends on your cash flow and goals. If you prefer not to make a large initial investment and value ongoing service, the monthly option is best. If you don't need regular service packages and can handle a larger upfront payment, the lump sum option will save you money over time.

                                Is SEO part of your packages?

                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            Yes and no. SEO is divided into two main components - On-page and Off-page optimization. On-page SEO focuses on elements within your website like content quality, page speed, accessibility standards, and information architecture. Off-page SEO addresses external factors such as backlink development, content partnerships, business listings, and other external signals.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Our website packages include fundamental on-page SEO elements: optimized loading performance, accessibility compliance, proper meta information, Google Search Console integration, XML sitemap configuration, and basic content development. However, this represents only part of a complete SEO strategy.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Effective SEO requires continuous effort and specialized expertise. For comprehensive SEO services, we collaborate with our specialist partner Adam Gingery, who provides these services separately from our website packages. If you're interested in a full-scale SEO program, we'd be happy to introduce you to Adam so he can explain his methodology, service options, and investment levels.

                            No we do not. E-commerce is a lot more work to set up than a regular business site. Since it has such high costs, we cannot afford to set them up for $175 a month. If you are interested in an e-commerce site, it would be best to reach out directly to chat about your specific needs!

The exact timeframe depends primarily on how quickly you provide requested content and images, plus our creative team's current availability. In some cases, we can deliver in as little as 2 weeks.

                                Do I retain my website if I end my subscription?

                            Unfortunately not, as this would undermine our business model. However, you maintain ownership of your domain name and all content assets you've provided.

                            Absolutely. We don't restrict domain ownership. Even when we've purchased the domain on your behalf, we'll transfer it to you if you decide to end your service with us.

                                Do you build with WordPress or page builders?

                            Not at all. We create every website with custom, hand-crafted code rather than using pre-built templates or page builders. This approach distinguishes our work and delivers superior results for our clients' digital presence after launch.

                                What benefits does custom code offer over WordPress?
                            </span>
                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            Custom code provides numerous advantages: enhanced security, faster loading speed, easier maintenance, reduced long-term costs, greater customization flexibility, and elimination of plugin dependencies. Unlike WordPress sites that require constant updates to prevent security breaches, our custom sites have no databases for hackers to target. This architecture creates inherently more secure websites without needing continuous updates or patches to protect against evolving threats.

                            Yup! If somewhere were to happen to me (the owner and operator), we have our dev partners throughout the US, and beyond who know our process inside and out. So if something happens to me, I have systems in place to take over. We will always have someone available to continue maintaining your site.
