            <h2>Custom Business Website Development</h2>
            <p>Tired of template websites that look like every other business in Manchester? Our web design services take a different approach. We custom-code every website from scratch, to create websites that capture your attention, load instantly, and most importantly - convert visitors into customers for your Manchester business.</p>
        
            <h2>Why Manchester Businesses Choose Our Web Design Services</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlike bloated website builders like Squarespace, Wix and Wordpress, our sites load under 1 second</li>
                <li>Highest possible Google speed scores (98-100/100)</li>
                <li>We build every website for mobile devices first, ensuring a smooth user-experience on all devices</li>
                <li>We hire professional copywriters to write your content to rank better in search engines and land better with customers</li>
                <li>You're not dealing with a large corporation when you need support - Just call Sam (I'm the owner & developer) and have it handled in less than 24 hours</li>
                <li>Monthly performance tracking</li>
                <li>Built-in conversion strategies</li>
                <li>Hack-proof architecture</li>
                <li>Unlimited design updates</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Performance That Sets You Apart</h2>
            <p>I've analyzed countless Manchester, NH business websites, and most scored between 30-40/100 on Google's Page Speed Insights metrics. You wanna know why? Because page builders and WordPress themes come loaded to the brim with unnecessary code that slows down your site. Our approach is different. We hand-coding each line which allows us to deliver websites that achieve perfect speed scores and give your business the competitive edge it needs in New Hampshire's largest city. Zero bloat, zero waste.</p>
        
            <h2>So Why Does Speed Even Matter?</h2>
            <p>When your website loads slowly, customers leave. In fact, studies show that after just 3 seconds of waiting, you've already lost half your customers. Most template-built websites along Elm Street and South Willow Street take 5-8 seconds to load. On the contrary, our custom-coded sites load in under a second, keeping your customers engaged and ready to buy instead of jumping ship to one of your competitors.</p>
        
            <h2>Local Businesses We Serve in Manchester</h2>
            <p>We can build websites for anyone! Our design team will make something custom and unique to your business that stands out from the rest. Here's our most common websites we build for small businesses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Downtown Elm Street businesses</li>
                <li>South Willow retail corridor</li>
                <li>Millyard tech companies</li>
                <li>Medical practices and healthcare</li>
                <li>Restaurants and hospitality</li>
                <li>Construction and home services</li>
                <li>Manufacturing facilities</li>
                <li>Auto dealerships and services</li>
                <li>Financial and legal firms</li>
                <li>Local service providers</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Our Streamlined Web Design Process</h2>
            <p>We've mastered our process and can go from start to finish in a matter of 2 weeks if our client is motivated. We start by sending each client a brief 10 - 15 questionnaire about their business - nothing crazy, just a few questions to learn about your design preferences, services, and what makes you stand out. Next, we walk through design concepts together via video call, and make sure that we are headed in the right direction for your NH business. Once you're 100% satisfied with the design, we start coding your site.</p>
        
            <h2>Local SEO Services for Manchester</h2>
            <p>Dominate local searches with our local SEO strategy. Beyond basic optimization, we create content that connects with Manchester customers, build quality backlinks, and optimize your Google Business Profile to capture more local traffic. Monthly reports show exactly how your visibility grows in Manchester's competitive market.
        
            <h2>Top-Notch Website Security</h2>
            <p> Our websites are virtually un-hackable. No plugins to update, no vulnerabilities to patch, and no databases for hackers to exploit. Just clean, efficient code helping drive customers to your business. Your Manchester business website stays secure year after year with zero maintenance required.</p>
        
            <h2>Mobile-First for Better Performance</h2>
            <p>Google recently prioritized mobile performance as a metric for organizing search rankings, which means it is extremely important that your website excels on smartphones and tablets. At Esker Designs, we take this into consideration by designing all our websites for mobile devices first, and then iterate on the design for progressively larger screens. This leads to better local rankings and higher conversion rates for your Manchester, NH business.</p>
        
            <h2>Affordable Website Investment</h2>
            <p>Premium web design shouldn't be out of reach for any Manchester business.
