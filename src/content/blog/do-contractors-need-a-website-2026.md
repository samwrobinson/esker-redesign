## Do Contractors Really Need a Website in 2026?

One of the most common pushbacks I hear from contractors is some version of this:

*"I get most of my work from referrals. Why would I pay for a website?"*

And honestly? It's a fair question. I talk to contractors all the time who've built successful businesses without ever having a website. Guys who've been in business for 20 years, stay busy, and have never needed anything more than word of mouth and a phone number.

So I'm not here to tell you that you absolutely need a website. That would be dishonest.

What I am here to do is help you figure out whether a website makes sense for your specific situation, because for a lot of contractors, not having one is a quiet, invisible cost they don't realize they're paying.

Let's get into it.

## The Case for Relying on Referrals

Before I make the case for having a website, I want to acknowledge when referrals genuinely are enough.

If you're a one-person operation and you already have more work than you can handle, you probably don't need more leads. If you're in a tight-knit community where everyone knows everyone and word travels fast, that network might be all you need. If you're winding down toward retirement and growth isn't on your radar, investing in a website might not make sense.

There are real advantages to running a referral-based business. Your marketing costs are zero. The leads that come in are pre-qualified because someone already vouched for you. Your close rate is higher because there's built-in trust. And you don't have to spend any time thinking about marketing.

If that describes your situation, you might genuinely be fine without a website. At least for now.

But here's where things get more complicated.

## The Hidden Cost of Being Invisible Online

Even if referrals are working for you, there's a cost to not existing online that most contractors don't think about.

Here's the reality: **97% of consumers search online for local services before calling anyone.** 76% of people who search for a local business on their phone visit or call within 24 hours. And nearly half of all Google searches have local intent; and what I mean by that is things like "plumber near me" or "roofers in Burlington."

So if you will, let me paint you a picture.

It's 7am on a Tuesday. Someone's water heater just failed. There's water pooling on the basement floor, and they need help fast. They're not going to call their neighbor and ask for a recommendation. They're not going to post on Facebook and wait for responses. They're grabbing their phone and searching "emergency plumber near me."

The reason I wanted to share this example is to illustrate this simple point; **if you don't exist online, you don't exist in that moment.** The job goes to someone else — maybe a contractor with half your experience — simply because they showed up in the search results and you didn't.

That's a $1,500 job you never even knew about. Multiply that by a few times a month, and the invisible cost starts to add up pretty quick.

## Even Your Referrals Are Googling You

Here's something a lot of contractors don't realize: even the people who get your name from a friend are going to Google you before they call.

Think about it. Someone's neighbor says, "You should call Mike, he did great work on our bathroom." What's the first thing that person does? They pull out their phone and search "Mike's Plumbing" or "Mike Thompson plumber Burlington" to check you out.

If someone were to do that for your business right now, what would they find?

If they find a professional website with photos of your work and some testimonials, that confirms the trust your referral already built. They call you feeling confident.

If they find a Facebook page you haven't updated in two years, they might still call, but you've lost some credibility before the conversation even starts.

If they find literally nothing, some people will call anyway. But a lot of them won't. They'll feel uncertain and move on to someone who looks more established, or might even wonder if you are still in business. The effort to answer those basic questions is enough to discourage a large percentage of customers from even trying.

**Here's a quick exercise:** Google your own business name right now and see what comes up. Is that the first impression you want potential customers to have?

## The Feast-or-Famine Problem

If you've been in the trades for any length of time, you know the pattern. Busy season hits and you're slammed; too busy to even think about marketing. Then things slow down and you're scrambling, wishing you had more leads coming in.

This is the feast-or-famine cycle, and it's baked into referral-dependent businesses.

The problem is that referrals are slow. A satisfied customer might refer you to two or three people over the course of a year or two, which is great, but it's not scalable and it's not predictable. There's a natural ceiling based on the size of your network, and you're entirely dependent on your previous client's dinner party conversations.

Let's say you want to grow from $200K to $400K in revenue. To do that, you'll need to roughly double your lead flow, and referrals alone will rarely get you there.

A website changes the equation because it works while you're working. Someone can find you at 11pm on a Saturday, look at photos of your work, read a few reviews, and fill out a contact form. You wake up Sunday morning to a lead you didn't have to lift a finger for.

And unlike referrals, a website compounds over time. The longer it exists and the more reviews you collect, the more visible it becomes. Referrals trickle in. A good website builds momentum.

## "But I Have a Facebook Page"

I hear this one a lot. And look, having a Facebook page is better than having nothing. But it's not a replacement for a website.

The biggest issue is that **Facebook doesn't show up in "near me" searches.** When someone searches "electrician near me," Google shows websites and Google Business Profiles. It doesn't show Facebook pages. So if Facebook is your only online presence, you're invisible to everyone who's actively searching for your services locally.

There's also the ownership problem. Facebook is rented land. They change their algorithm constantly, and organic reach is a fraction of what it used to be. You're building your business presence on a platform you don't control. Mark Zuckerburg (while very unlikely) could hypothetically turn off your profile at any point, or charge a massive premium for businesses to advertise on their platform, and you would have no say in the matter.

And most importantly, fair or not, a Facebook-only business often looks less established than one with a real website. Lot's of people might view your business as more of a side-hustle or passion project than a legitimate business. It shouldn't matter, but first impressions are hard to shake. Personally, I wouldn't hire someone to build my house after looking at a Facebook profile - but that's just me.

That's not to say Facebook is useless. It's great for showing off completed projects, staying top-of-mind with past customers, paid advertising, and building community in your local area. But think of it as a supplement, not a substitute. Your website is home base. Social media is one of the roads that leads there.

## What About Just Using Google Business Profile?

This is a more interesting question, because Google Business Profile is actually pretty powerful for local businesses, and it's free.

If you're just starting out and have zero budget, setting up a Google Business Profile is the single highest-ROI thing you can do. It shows up in local search results, it lets you collect reviews, and it gives people basic information about your business. For some very small operations, this genuinely might be enough for a while.

But there are limitations.

With a Google Business Profile, you can't really control the narrative. You get a few fields to fill out, but you can't explain your process, show a detailed portfolio, tell your story, or differentiate yourself from the ten other contractors in the same list.

You're also competing in a box where everyone looks basically the same. It comes down to reviews, proximity, and who happens to show up first. You can't guide someone through why they should choose you over the next guy.

And here's the part that makes me nervous about relying on GBP alone: **you don't own it, and Google can change the rules whenever they want.**

Profiles get suspended all the time, sometimes for reasons that make sense and sometimes for reasons that are completely unclear. I've talked to contractors who woke up one morning to find their listing gone; no warning, no explanation, just a form to fill out and weeks of waiting to maybe get it back. If that profile is your entire online presence, you're starting from zero while your competitors keep getting calls.

Reviews are another vulnerability. Yes, they can be very powerful — a strong review profile can absolutely drive business. But one or two bad reviews from unreasonable customers can tank your visibility overnight. And Google's review system is a black box. Legitimate reviews get removed for no apparent reason. Fake reviews from competitors sometimes stick around. You have very little recourse either way.

The point isn't that Google Business Profile is bad. It's actually genuinely useful, and one of the top recommendations that I give to all my clients (you should absolutely have one). But building your entire online presence on a platform you don't control is risky. Your GBP listing is Google's property. A website is yours.

Think of it this way: **a Google Business Profile is like a business card. A website is like a showroom.** Both serve a purpose, but they do very different jobs. And only one of them can't be taken away from you without warning.

## The Real Question to Ask Yourself

Instead of asking "do I need a website," I think there are better questions to consider.

**First, are you turning away work right now?** If you're genuinely booked solid and can't take on more, you might not need additional leads. But if you've got capacity and you're waiting for the phone to ring, that's a lead generation problem.

**Second, where do you want to be in three years?** If you're happy at your current size and don't have ambitions to grow, referrals might be fine. But if you want to expand, hire help, or eventually sell your business, you need predictable lead flow, and that's hard to build on referrals alone.

**Third, what happens if your referral network dries up?** Key customers move away. Your best referrer retires. The economy shifts. How resilient is your business if word of mouth slows down?

**Fourth, are you competing against contractors who have websites?** If your competitors are investing in their online presence and you're not, you're ceding ground every single day. Every time someone searches for your service and finds them instead of you, that's a potential job lost.

Here's a simple test: Google your trade plus your city right now. "Plumber Burlington" or "electrician Montpelier" or whatever applies to you. Look at who shows up. Those are the contractors getting the calls you're not getting.

Are you okay with that?

## What a Contractor Website Actually Needs

If you're starting to think a website might make sense, I don't want you to feel overwhelmed. Contractor websites don't need to be complicated. In fact, the simpler ones often work better.

Here's what you actually need.

**You need a clear statement of what you do and where you do it.** Something like "Licensed plumber serving Chittenden County and surrounding areas." Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many contractor websites make you hunt for this basic information.

**You need your phone number visible on every page.** Not buried in a contact page. In the header, where people can see it immediately on any device.

**You need photos of your actual work.** Real jobs you've completed, and PLEASE - no stock photos. This is your biggest differentiator. Anyone can claim to do quality work. Photos prove it, and most importantly, they lead to the reviews and word of mouth that will keep bringing your business for years to come.

**You also need a few testimonials.** Even just three to five good ones make a real difference. People want to know that others have had good experiences with you.

**And you need a simple way to contact you.** A phone number, a basic contact form, or both. Don't make people jump through hoops.

That's really it for most contractors. You don't need a blog, you don't need fancy animations, you don't need twenty pages of content. A fast, clean, mobile-friendly site with your phone number and photos of your work will outperform 80% of contractor websites out there.

With that said, there are other ways to really move the needle like have 20+ 5-star reviews on your Google Business Profile, a content strategy and blog content on your website to capture informational search queries if your budget allows, and potentially some paid lead generation through Facebook or Google Ads.

## The Cost Reality

I'm not going to go deep on pricing here because I wrote a whole separate article breaking down website costs in detail. But to give you a quick reference point:

If you go the DIY route with something like Wix or Squarespace, you're looking at maybe $200-500 per year in actual costs, but you're also investing 20-40 hours of your own time to build it and learn the platform, and a few hours per month doing regular maintenance.

If you hire a freelancer, expect somewhere in the $2,000-5,000 range for a basic site, plus you'll need to figure out ongoing maintenance.

Agencies typically start around $8,000 and go up from there, often significantly.

My own subscription model is $175 per month with no upfront cost, which includes the site, hosting, maintenance, and ongoing support.

But here's the way I'd encourage you to think about it: if your average job is $2,000 and a website brings you even one extra job per month, it pays for itself many times over. The question isn't really "can I afford a website." It's "can I afford to keep missing the jobs I don't even know about?"

## So, Do You Actually Need a Website?

Let me bring this back to where we started.

If you're genuinely maxed out on work, happy with your current business size, and have a reliable referral network that shows no signs of slowing down, you might be fine without a website. I mean that sincerely. Not every business needs one, and I'm not in the business of selling people things they don't need.

But if you've ever wondered why work slows down at certain times of year, or lost a job to a competitor you know you're better than, or wished you had more control over where your leads come from, or thought about growing your business beyond where it is today — then the answer is probably yes.

Not because some marketing person told you so. But because the math makes sense.

A website isn't a magic bullet. It's a tool. But for most contractors, it's a tool that pays for itself quickly and keeps working long after you've stopped thinking about it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I just use Facebook instead of a website?

Facebook is useful for showing off your work and staying connected with past customers, but it won't show up when someone searches "contractor near me" on Google. Most contractors benefit from having both, but if you can only do one thing, a website will generate more leads.

### How much does a contractor website cost?

It ranges quite a bit. DIY platforms run $200-500 per year plus your time. Freelancers typically charge $2,000-5,000. Agencies start around $8,000 and go up from there. Subscription services like mine run $150-200 per month with no upfront cost.

### What pages does a contractor website need?

At minimum, you need a homepage that clearly states what you do and where, some photos of your work, a few testimonials, and your contact information. Most contractor sites don't need more than five to seven pages total.

### Do I need to write blog posts to rank on Google?

Not necessarily. A well-optimized site with good reviews and proper local SEO can rank without a blog. Blogging helps if you're willing to do it consistently, but it's not required for a contractor website to be effective.

### How long does it take for a website to start generating leads?

It varies depending on your local competition and how well the site is optimized. Some contractors see leads within a few weeks. For others, it takes three to six months to build momentum. Collecting Google reviews helps speed this up significantly.
