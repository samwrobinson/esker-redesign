title: Page Speed, Best Practices, SEO, Accessibility, and Why it All Matters
url: /website-speed
description: Page speed is super important in today’s digital landscape, as it
  directly affects user experience, SEO rankings and even accessibility. A
  slow-loading webpage can frustrate visitors, leading them to leave before they
  even see what you offer. Best practices for improving page speed include
  optimizing images, minimizing HTML and CSS files, and leveraging browser
  caching to enhance performance. Moreover, these practices not only boost your
  site's visibility on search engines but also make it more accessible for users
  with disabilities who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.
  Ultimately, prioritizing page speed is crucial because it helps retain users
  and conveys a sense of professionalism that can set a website apart from its
  competitors. In the end, keeping all of these elements in check contributes to
  better overall online presence and success.

In the fast-paced digital world, a website's speed can make or break user experiences. At Esker Designs, we prioritize every aspect of website performance, from page speed and best practices to SEO and accessibility, as shown in the recent PageSpeed Insights report for Alpenglow Counseling’s site. This perfect 100 performance score demonstrates what thoughtful optimization can achieve. But why do these elements matter so much?

### The Importance of Page Speed

Imagine visiting a website and waiting for ages as it loads. Chances are, you’d leave before seeing the content. Page speed is more than just a technical metric—it directly impacts user retention, engagement, and conversion rates. Research consistently shows that faster-loading pages have lower bounce rates and lead to better user satisfaction. Improving page speed can involve optimizing images, minifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and reducing render-blocking resources - something that can be impossible to do using page builders, or difficult to understand without the appropriate technical background to implement. It’s an ongoing process that ensures your visitors don’t turn away, and **at Esker Designs, we take care of all of this for you**.

### Following Best Practices 

A key component of web development involves adhering to best practices. These include writing clean, semantic HTML, using appropriate tags for accessibility, and ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices. When done right, this helps create a stable and user-friendly web experience, ultimately building trust with visitors. At Esker Designs, our projects consistently demonstrate how following best practices leads to high scores in site evaluations, giving our clients a competitive edge in the digital space.

Another major component of best practices is adopting a mobile-first approach. This means designing and developing websites with mobile devices as the primary focus before scaling layouts to fit larger screens like laptops and desktops. With the vast majority of internet browsing occurring on handheld devices, failing to optimize for mobile is a significant oversight. Websites that prioritize a seamless mobile experience engage users more effectively, reduce bounce rates, and encourage return visits. If you aren't optimizing for mobile, you're missing a crucial opportunity to connect with your audience where they spend most of their time.

### Why SEO and Accessibility Go Hand in Hand

Search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility are often considered separate areas, but they are deeply intertwined. Optimized websites rank higher on search engine results pages, making it easier for users to discover your services. This involves practices such as keyword research, creating optimized meta descriptions, and paying attention to alt text on images. Beyond improving rankings, these efforts also make content more accessible to users with disabilities, such as those who rely on screen readers.

At Esker Designs, accessibility is a major pillar of our work. We strongly believe that every user, regardless of their background or physical abilities, should be able to navigate and use our websites seamlessly. High scores in SEO and accessibility aren't just metrics—they reflect a commitment to an inclusive and meaningful user experience. By ensuring that everyone can access and engage with our sites, we aim to create spaces that are welcoming, functional, and beneficial to all visitors.

### Bringing It All Together 



Each of these factors—speed, best practices, SEO, and accessibility—contributes to the success of a website. A slow site is less likely to be seen by search engines or users, poor practices can lead to frustrating experiences, and neglecting accessibility can exclude large user groups. Prioritizing these elements shows a commitment to delivering a professional, inclusive, and enjoyable web experience. In the end, a fast, optimized, and accessible site stands out from the competition, retaining users, and leaving a lasting impression.

We handle all of this at Esker Designs, so you can focus on your business. While optimizing for these metrics is possible with page builders, many small business owners simply don’t have the technical background or the time to do so. Running a business is demanding, and it often makes sense in the short term to prioritize revenue growth or other pressing goals. However, overlooking these "smaller details" can have lasting consequences, potentially limiting your business's success and leaving users with subpar web experiences.

At Esker Designs, our focus on these elements ensures that your online presence remains strong, impactful, and crafted for success. By taking care of the technical and optimization aspects, we allow you to do what you do best—growing your business—while knowing your website is performing at its peak.
