# **Advantages of Single Page Websites for Businesses**

## **What is a single page website?**

A single page website is exactly what it sounds like: a website that consists of only one page. Instead of having multiple pages for different types of content, everything is placed on one long page. This design approach is streamlined, allowing users to scroll through the content seamlessly. While this isn't a strategy that I would recommend for all businesses, there are some legitimate use-cases where this type of website can make a lot of sense.

## **Benefits of a Single Page Web Design**

Single page design is about minimizing clutter and maximizing impact. By putting all the information on one page, it creates a narrative flow that guides the user naturally from one section to the next. This means visitors are more likely to receive the entire message as intended, because these sites are designed to be informationally dense to deliver fast value to the reader. It also reduces the need for navigating multiple pages, which can be a barrier for users who prefer straightforward browsing experiences.

A single page website inherently adopts a user-centric approach. With everything laid out on one page, the user does not need to search for information; no guessing games - just quick information right where they need it. Instead, they are guided through a logical progression of content, which can be particularly beneficial for storytelling or presenting a linear message.

Navigation on a single page site is inherently streamlined. With fewer clicks required to reach any section of the site, users can explore content with minimal effort. This seamless experience is particularly appealing to users who are accustomed to the fast-paced nature of digital content consumption. When people are on the look-out for fast information, they aren't likely to read a website thoroughly, navigate through tabs etc. - they just want to hop on, give a quick scan, and get out with what they came for.

## **Faster Performance and Load Times**

Single page websites typically load faster than their multi-page counterparts. With fewer resources to fetch and no need to load entirely new pages as users navigate, your visitors get to your content quickly. This matters more than you might think—faster load times lead to better engagement, lower bounce rates, and improved search engine rankings. By optimizing the page with the right keywords and ensuring lightning fast page speeds, single page websites can be a great way to get those #1 rankings depending on your use-case.

The streamlined nature of a single page site also means less data consumption, which benefits users on mobile devices or in areas with slower internet connections.

## **Built for Mobile**

In a mobile-first world, one page web design has a natural advantage. The scrolling behavior that defines single page websites aligns perfectly with how people use their phones—swiping through content feels intuitive in a way that tapping through menus doesn't.

Single page sites are also easier to make fully responsive. With one layout to optimize rather than many, you can ensure a consistent experience whether someone visits from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

## **A Cost-Effective Option**

Let's talk budget. Creating a single page website is generally [more affordable](https://eskerdesigns.com/blog/affordable-web-design-for-small-businesses/) than building a multi-page site—there's simply less to design, develop, and maintain. For startups, small businesses, or anyone launching a focused campaign, this approach lets you establish a professional online presence without a significant investment.

Ongoing maintenance is simpler too. With one page to update and monitor, you'll spend less time and money keeping things current.

There are important trade-offs to consider, however, such as how many services/products you offer, and whether or not it would be beneficial to have individual pages for each product and/or service. This is really something that would be best discussed with an SEO expert or web developer, so I highly suggest you [contact us](https://eskerdesigns.com/contact/) to discuss your particular situation and business needs.

## **How to Create a Single Page Website**

### **Choose the Right One Page Website Builder**

Getting started is easier than ever with modern website builders. Platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace all offer templates designed specifically for single page websites. Many even offer free one page website options if you're working with a tight budget.

When evaluating a one page website builder or single page website creator, look for flexibility in design customization, built-in mobile responsiveness, and solid SEO tools. The right platform depends on your technical comfort level and specific needs.

This is definitely something you can bootstrap as a beginning to get your business up and running quickly, but down the road, it is best practice to seek some expert guidance regarding keyword research, content strategy, backlink building, and all the other fun stuff that will really take a good website and turn it into a great one.

### **Plan Your Content Strategically**

With limited real estate, every section needs to earn its place. Start by identifying your core message; what's the ***one*** thing you want visitors to understand or do? Build outward from there, organizing content into distinct sections that flow logically.

Keep your copy concise and focused on delivering value. Use headings and visual breaks to improve scannability, but resist the urge to cram everything in. A single page website works best when it's focused, not when it tries to do everything a full site would do. Give people as much information as they *need* without overwhelming them or providing too much fluff or keyword stuffing. The last thing you want to do is sacrifice the user-experience to get a few more keywords into your content.

### **Design for Visual Impact**

Your single page site needs to look good and function well. Use high-quality images that support your message, maintain a consistent color scheme and typography throughout, and don't underestimate the power of white space. A cluttered single page defeats the purpose entirely.

### **Make Navigation Easy**

Even with just one page, you need clear navigation. Anchor links allow users to jump directly to specific sections, and a sticky menu keeps those options accessible as they scroll. Visual cues like arrows or subtle animations can guide users through the content and draw attention to important elements. This is a major help, because no one likes scrolling all over a page up and down just to reference content again. There is no quicker way to bounce a website visitor than to make your site inconvenient for them to use.

## **SEO Considerations for Single Page Sites**

Don't skip SEO just because you only have one page to optimize. Identify relevant keywords for your business and work them naturally into your content, headings, and meta descriptions. Focus on long-tail keywords that match what your audience is actually searching for.

Build quality backlinks where you can, and prioritize page speed; compress your images, minimize HTTP requests, and enable browser caching. Search engines favor fast-loading sites, and single page websites have a natural advantage here if you don't weigh them down with unoptimized assets.

Most importantly, make sure that your page *content* matches the user's *search intent*. This is an important one, and to explain what I mean, I will provide an example. If you make a one-page website to advertise a craft fair that you are hosting, don't use the page to try and sell your brand new online crafting course. The reason is that you want Google and your site visitors to find value in your content, so if you are keyword stuffing in random ranking terms just to move the SEO needle without considering your visitors search intent, you are wasting a lot of hard work because people will arrive on your site, realize it is not what they expected and **leave**. And that doesn't help anyone!

## **Don't Forget Your Calls to Action**

A beautiful single page website means nothing if it doesn't drive action. Place clear, compelling calls to action throughout your page-not just at the bottom. Whether you want visitors to sign up, make a purchase, or get in touch, make the next step obvious.

Use contrasting colors and direct language for your CTAs. Test different placements and wording to see what resonates with your audience.

## **When Single Page Websites Work Best**

### **Creative Portfolios**

For photographers, designers, artists, and other creatives, a single page portfolio website offers an elegant way to showcase work. Visitors can scroll through a curated gallery without distraction, getting a clear sense of your style and capabilities in one seamless experience.

### **Event Websites**

Events are a perfect fit for single page design. You can present the schedule, location, speakers, and registration information all in one place. Attendees get everything they need without hunting through multiple pages, and you can easily update details as the event approaches.

### **Marketing Landing Pages**

When you're running a focused campaign around a single product, service, or offer, a one page website keeps visitors locked in on your message. There are no distracting navigation options pulling attention away—just a clear path from interest to conversion.

## **Is a Single Page Website Right for You?**

Single page websites offer real advantages: simplicity, speed, mobile-friendliness, and cost savings. They're excellent for focused messages, specific campaigns, and situations where you want to control the narrative flow.

That said, they're not ideal for every situation. If you have extensive content, need robust SEO across multiple topics, or require complex functionality, a traditional multi-page site will serve you better. The good news is that we handle multi-page sites as well, and honestly, think that they are a better use case for most businesses anyway. If you are interested in exploring those options, feel free to check out [our offerings](https://eskerdesigns.com/web-design-service/).

But if your goals are focused and your message is clear, a well-crafted single page website can be remarkably effective. The key is knowing when this approach fits—and executing it well when it does.
